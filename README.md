# Lúo

Lúo is an expert system with the purpose of being a web solution for inference questions returning the expected answer at the end.

The project is requires a database to work and currently doesn't have a GUI for creating the rules/logic.

You can test a version [here](http://www.mghenschel.com.br/projects/furb/luo/login) (available only in Portuguese - Brazil).

## Future

### To do

- Start with question
- Import/Export
- Author page
- Allow "empty" values for variables
- Avoid loop (generate node of rules that are above in the tree)

### Ideas

- Password protected system
- Interface to create system / add rules
- Add _else_ option
- Suggest shortest way (or let person decide if wants to order, ask less questions, etc...)
- Alert for inconsistencies
- Allow float fields
- Compare fields
- Regular Expression for String
- Multiple? Numeric intervals

Lúo was built by @mghextreme and @evandroMSchmitz as a college project for AI classes.
